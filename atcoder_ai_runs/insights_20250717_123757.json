  "cluster_0": "These problems all involve a grid of rooms, with doors between adjacent rooms, and doors on the left and right sides of each room. The goal is to determine whether it is possible to reach an exit door from an entrance door by passing through open doors, and to find a strategy for achieving this goal.\n\nThe common theme is that these problems can be modeled as a game between two players, where one player tries to achieve the objective and the other player tries to prevent it. The players take turns choosing doors to fix as open or closed. The problems involve finding a winning strategy for one of the players, and implementing it interactively.\n\nThe difficulties include understanding the game-theoretic aspects, designing a strategy that guarantees a win for",
  "cluster_1": "These programming problems all involve finding the number of binary matrices that satisfy certain conditions. The matrices are constrained by their dimensions, and the rows and columns must be sorted in lexicographical order. The output is the answer for all pairs of dimensions within a given range, modulo a specified number.\n\nThe common theme is the use of dynamic programming to solve the problem. The dynamic programming approach involves creating a table to store the number of valid matrices for each pair of dimensions. The table is filled by iteratively applying the conditions and constraints of the problem. The final answer is then calculated by summing up the values in the table.\n\nThe main difficulty lies in efficiently computing the number of valid matrices for each pair of dimensions. This requires a careful",
  "cluster_2": "These problems involve finding the minimum number of elements to remove from a list so that no two remaining elements are within a certain distance of each other. They are all solved using greedy algorithms.\n\nIn the first problem, the goal is to remove the minimum number of typos from a dissertation so that no consecutive T pages contain multiple typos. The solution is to sort the pages with typos by their page number and then iterate through the sorted list, removing any typos that are within T pages of the previous typo. This greedy approach ensures that the minimum number of typos are removed while satisfying the constraint.\n\nThe second problem involves removing the minimum number of boxes so that no two remaining boxes have a side length difference of at most D. The solution is to",
  "cluster_3": "These programming problems primarily involve working with arrays, matrices, and strings, and they require efficient algorithms and data structures to solve them. Common themes include:\n\n- **Array manipulation**: Many of the problems involve manipulating arrays, such as finding the maximum or minimum element, sorting the array, or performing operations on specific elements.\n- **Matrix operations**: Several problems involve working with matrices, such as finding the transpose, calculating the determinant, or performing matrix multiplication.\n- **String manipulation**: Some problems involve manipulating strings, such as finding the longest common substring, reversing a string, or checking if one string is a rotation of another.\n- **Dynamic programming**: Dynamic programming is a technique used to solve optimization problems by breaking them down into smaller",
  "cluster_4": "These programming problem descriptions all involve manipulating strings, arrays, and linked lists to achieve a specific output or meet certain constraints. Common themes include:\n\n- String manipulation: Many of the problems involve manipulating strings by reversing, sorting, or comparing them.\n- Array manipulation: Some of the problems involve manipulating arrays by sorting, merging, or finding the maximum or minimum element.\n- Linked lists: Several of the problems involve working with linked lists, including traversing, inserting, or deleting nodes.\n- Recursion: Recursion is a common technique used in many of the problem solutions, particularly for problems involving linked lists or tree structures.\n- Sorting and searching: Efficient sorting and searching algorithms are important for solving many of the problems, such as"
