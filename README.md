🚀 AutoScraper Project – Progress Report (Phase 1 → Phase 6)

# Walkthrough: scraper → analyzer → AI summarizer → semantic enricher pipeline with clean modular design

✅ Phase 1 – Core Scraping Engine
Goal: Build a robust, reusable web scraping core.

What we did:

Implemented fetch_page() with retries, backoff, and timeout.

Built scrape_with_pagination() to handle multi-page scraping with CSS selectors.

Extracted text, normalized into Python dict rows.

Successfully scraped any site given a base URL & selectors.
✔️ Outcome: A stable scraping backbone.

✅ Phase 2 – Config-Based Runs (CLI Integration)
Goal: Make scraping configurable & easy to run.

What we did:

Built a Typer CLI with commands (fetch, run_config).

Enabled JSON config files (url, selectors, pagination) for different sites.

Added options: --csv, --max-pages, --retries, --timeout, --output.

Previewed top scraped items directly in CLI.
✔️ Outcome: Reusable scraper with zero hardcoding, ready for multiple use‑cases.

✅ Phase 3 – Classification & EDA
Goal: Turn raw scraped data into a clean, analyzable dataset.

What we did:

Integrated SimpleClassifier for basic tag prediction (rule‑based: life/truth/love etc.).

Implemented run_eda():

Deduplicated entries.

Cleaned text (whitespace, casing).

Generated summary JSON (counts, basic insights).

Output: output_cleaned.csv and insights.json.
✔️ Outcome: Structured and cleaned dataset, ready for analysis.

✅ Phase 4 – AI Insights (Clustering)
Goal: Discover patterns in scraped data using ML.

What we did:

Used SentenceTransformers (all-MiniLM-L6-v2) to embed each text.

Applied KMeans clustering (clusters = n) to group similar items.

Saved output_ai_tagged.csv with an ai_cluster column.

Produced cluster distribution JSON (ai_insights.json).
✔️ Outcome: Semantic grouping of scraped items, revealing hidden patterns.

✅ Phase 5 – Cluster Summaries (Cohere AI)
Goal: Generate human-readable summaries of each cluster.

What we did:

Implemented describe_clusters():

For each cluster, took top N examples.

Built a prompt: “Summarize these items and describe their theme.”

Sent prompt to Cohere (command-xlarge).

Saved natural-language summaries to cluster_descriptions.json.

Fully integrated as a CLI command: gpt_describe_clusters.
✔️ Outcome: AI-powered descriptions that explain clusters in plain English.

✅ Phase 6 – Semantic Enrichment (Deduplication & Normalization)
Goal: Refine and enrich the dataset beyond basic cleaning.

What we did:

Implemented semantic_enrich():

Loaded output_cleaned.csv.

Encoded texts with SentenceTransformers.

Measured cosine similarity across items.

Merged near-duplicates (threshold configurable: default 0.90).

Added CLI command enrich with options:

--input-csv, --output-csv, --sim-threshold.

Ran successfully: data remained 30→30 rows (no high-sim duplicates).
✔️ Outcome: A semantically normalized dataset, primed for downstream use.

🌟 Current Status
✅ You have a fully functional scraping-to-insights pipeline:

Scrape with config.

Clean & classify.

Cluster with AI.

Summarize clusters with Cohere.

Enrich & deduplicate semantically.

✅ Modular CLI commands (fetch, run_config, eda, ai_insights, gpt_describe_clusters, enrich).

✅ Outputs are versioned (output_cleaned.csv, output_ai_tagged.csv, cluster_descriptions.json, output_enriched.csv).

✨ What’s Next (Phase 7 Preview)
Phase 7 – Database & API Integration:

Store enriched datasets in PostgreSQL/MongoDB.

Expose FastAPI endpoints to query/filter/search clusters or tags.

Make it scalable and ready for deployment.
